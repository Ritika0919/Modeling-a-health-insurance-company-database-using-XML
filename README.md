# Modeling a health insurance company database using XML
In this project, I first created a dummy database with the name, age, gender, date of birth, weight (in kg), height (in cm), allergies and diseases. I then created 10 dummy patient records to fill in the database. Lastly, I wrote xml statements to retrieve case specific patient records.
